{"RF_INTRO_IPOD":"iPod touch has been tested and meets applicable limits for Radio Frequency (RF) exposure.<br><br>Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) refers to the rate at which the body absorbs RF energy. SAR limits are 1.6 Watts per Kilogram (over a volume containing a mass of 1 gram of tissue) in countries that follow the United States FCC limit and 2.0 W\/Kg (averaged over 10 grams of tissue) in countries that follow the Council of the European Union limit.
