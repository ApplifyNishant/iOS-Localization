None of the collected information identifies you personally. Personal data is either not logged at all or is removed from any reports before they’re sent to Apple.

This diagnostic location data may include, for example, the location of your device once per day, the location where a call ends, or the location where a cellular error occurs. You may choose to turn off Location Services for Diagnostics at any time. To do so, open Settings, tap Location Services, tap System Services and turn off the Diagnostics switch.\n\nYou may also choose to turn off Diagnostics altogether.

Once saved, the password or credit card information will auto fill so that you do not have to type it in again. Safari Autofill and iCloud Keychain will not store your credit card security code.  For example, when making a purchase in Safari, select the credit card you want to use and Safari will automatically fill out the credit card number and expiration date. You will still need to type in your security code to complete the purchase. Safari’s new Password Generator can also suggest unique, hard-to-guess passwords for your online accounts and use iCloud Keychain to store these passwords.  If you restore your device from a backup, iCloud Keychain can automatically sign in to your saved accounts.\n\nYour iCloud Keychain is encrypted when transmitted to your devices and when stored in iCloud, and cannot be read by Apple.\n\nYou can setup your iCloud Keychain on a second device by authorizing that device from your original device, allowing you to keep your iCloud Keychain up to date just across the devices you have approved.  You can also set up a four-digit, complex, or random Security Code to sync your passwords to a new device.  You should write down your Security Code, and keep it in a safe place.
